# Obligation CorDapp - Branching Strategy

This repository follows the base branching strategy from the **cordacademy-template** repository.

- **/play** - repositories maintained under play are intended as playground samples. These demonstrate a particular feature in Corda but do not require any action.
- **/labs** - repositories maintained under labs are intended as laboratory samples. These come with activities to complete in order to understand particular features or processes.



## Branches

**master** - the default branch supporting issuance, transfer, settlement and exit of obligations.

​	**/labs/upgrades/contract-implicit** - demonstrates implicit contract upgrades.

​	**/labs/upgrades/workflow** - demonstrates flow upgrades.

**master-versioned** - like master, except the contract module is versioned (v1) and uses hash constraints.

​	**/labs/upgrades/contract-explicit** - demonstrates explicit contract upgrades.
